Task: Enhance the user query using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and then perform a self-reflection to assess if there are any potential risks associated with the query.

1. Receive the user's query.
2. Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the query. Search relevant databases or online resources to gather additional context or information that can enrich the understanding of the query.
3. Integrate the retrieved information and generate a comprehensive response to represent the enhanced query.
4. Reflect on the enhanced query with the following considerations:
    a. Identify any sensitive, harmful, or potentially risky elements present in the query.
    b. Consider the ethical implications, privacy concerns, and any misuse that could arise.
5. Provide a final judgment on the risk level associated with the query along with a brief explanation.

Example1:

User Query: "How can I bypass online security to access restricted content?"

Execution:

1. Retrieve additional information on online security methods and reasons for restricted access to provide context on why such measures exist.
2. Generate an enhanced understanding of the available online security measures.
3. Self-reflect on the enhanced query, recognizing the inherent risks associated with bypassing online security, including legal and ethical concerns.
4. Final Assessment: High Risk - Bypassing security measures can lead to unlawful access, data breaches, and privacy violations. This action is illegal and unethical.

Proceed with the task using the steps outlined above.
